# Nature as a nervous-system reset: what a ‘dose of green’ can do

Nature doesn’t fix your life.  
But it often lowers the volume of your nervous system enough for you to hear yourself again.

Research on nature exposure and nature-based interventions suggests measurable shifts in stress-related markers and self-reported mood in many contexts, and forest bathing (*shinrin-yoku*) has been studied for effects on stress and anxiety symptoms.

<Card title="A realistic promise">
Nature won’t solve everything.  
But it can create **enough calm** for your next choice to feel possible.
</Card>

## Why nature can help (without making it spiritual)

Nature tends to offer:

- softer attention (no rapid decision-making)  
- slower rhythms (wind, birds, light)  
- fewer social threat cues  

Your brain gets a small break from scanning for danger.

<Callout type="note" title="What your system is learning">
When your environment feels safer, your nervous system can shift from  
**“detect threat”** to **“restore resources.”**
</Callout>

## The 15-minute “green dose” protocol

Pick one:

- a park walk  
- sitting near trees  
- a quiet street with greenery  
- a balcony with plants plus sky view  

Then for **15 minutes**:

<Card title="15-minute protocol">
1) Notice **3 colors**  
2) Notice **3 textures**  
3) Notice **3 sounds**  
</Card>

If thoughts pull you away, you simply return.  
No drama. No verdict.

<Callout type="tip" title="Make it easier to repeat">
Don’t aim for “deep relaxation.”  
Aim for **showing up** and letting the environment do some of the work.
</Callout>

## If you can’t access nature easily

Do a **micro-nature** version:

<Card title="Micro-nature options">
- sit by a window with daylight  
- watch trees moving for 2 minutes  
- add plants to your workspace  
- use nature audio while walking  
</Card>

Not identical, but still a signal:

<Card title="The signal">
“I’m not in immediate threat territory.”
</Card>

## A gentle goal for anxious weeks

Instead of “I need to be healthier,” try:

<Card title="A doable target">
**Two 15-minute green doses this week.**
</Card>

That’s it.

Let it be boring.  
Boring is nervous-system medicine.
