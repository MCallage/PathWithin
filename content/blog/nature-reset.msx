# Nature as a nervous-system reset: what a ‘dose of green’ can do

Nature doesn’t fix your life.
But it often lowers the volume of your nervous system enough for you to hear yourself again.

Research on nature exposure and nature-based interventions suggests measurable shifts in stress-related markers and self-reported mood in many contexts, and forest bathing (shinrin-yoku) has been studied for effects on stress and anxiety symptoms.

## Why nature can help (without making it spiritual)

Nature tends to offer:
- softer attention (no rapid decision-making)
- slower rhythms (wind, birds, light)
- fewer social threat cues

Your brain gets a small break from scanning for danger.

## The 15-minute “green dose” protocol
Pick one:

- a park walk
- sitting near trees
- a quiet street with greenery
- a balcony with plants plus sky view

Then for 15 minutes:
1) notice **3 colors**
2) notice **3 textures**
3) notice **3 sounds**

If thoughts pull you away, you simply return.
No drama. No verdict.

## If you can’t access nature easily
Do a “micro-nature” version:
- sit by a window with daylight
- watch trees moving for 2 minutes
- add plants to your workspace
- use nature audio while walking

Not identical, but still a signal:
“I’m not in immediate threat territory.”

## A gentle goal for anxious weeks
Instead of “I need to be healthier,” try:
**two 15-minute green doses this week.**

That’s it.
Let it be boring.
Boring is nervous-system medicine.
