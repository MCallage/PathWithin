# Worry time: how to postpone anxiety without bottling it up

Anxiety loves open tabs.

Not the browser kind. The mental kind:
“What if I mess up?”
“What if they leave?”
“What if the future collapses like a cheap chair?”

If you try to force-close every tab, anxiety fights back.
If you leave them all open, you crash.

**Worry time** is a compromise:  
“I will worry, but not *everywhere*. Not *all day*. I’ll give it a room.”

Research on worry-focused approaches (including worry postponement and structured worry exercises) suggests that **shifting worry into a defined window** can reduce how much it hijacks the rest of the day for some people.

## The idea (simple, not magical)

- You are not trying to “stop worrying.”
- You are training your brain to learn:  
  **worry is not an emergency alarm. It’s a scheduled meeting.**

## Step-by-step: the 10-minute version

### 1) Pick a worry slot
Choose **10–20 minutes**, once per day.
Pick a time that’s *not* right before bed.

Name it something lightly ridiculous:
“Anxiety Office Hours.”
“Catastrophe Consulting.”
“Doom & Co.”

### 2) When worry hits outside the slot: postpone it
Say (out loud if you can):

> “Not now. I’ll meet you at 6:10.”

Then write a quick note:
- Worry topic: ______
- Trigger: ______
- One sentence summary: ______

That’s it. No debate. No trial.

### 3) In the worry slot: do it with structure
Split your time:

**5 minutes: dump the worries**
Write every worry in bullet form.

**5–10 minutes: convert 1 worry into a plan**
Pick just one and ask:

- What is the *real* problem here?
- What part is controllable (even 1%)?
- What is the smallest next step?

Example:
- Worry: “I’m going to fail everything.”
- Controllable: “I can email my professor / outline the next task.”
- Next step: “Write a 5-line plan.”

## If your worry feels “valid”
Good. Worry time isn’t denial.

It’s **timing**.
A fire alarm might be valid, but you still don’t want it screaming all day.

## A tiny script for the hardest moments
If postponing feels impossible:

- “I can’t solve this now.”
- “I’m allowed to pause.”
- “I’ll return to it with paper and a clock.”

You’re not avoiding. You’re **containing**.
