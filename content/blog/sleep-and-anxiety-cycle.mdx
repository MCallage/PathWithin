# Sleep and anxiety: they feed each other (and how to break the cycle without becoming a hostage to discipline)

When sleep gets worse, almost everything gets harder:

- emotional tolerance drops  
- focus collapses  
- catastrophic thoughts feel more believable  

And when anxiety rises, sleep turns into an endurance test.

<Card title="The loop">
Poor sleep makes anxiety louder.  
Anxiety makes sleep harder.  
That feedback loop is real, and it’s not a character flaw.
</Card>

The scientific evidence is consistent on one important point: **interventions that improve sleep tend to improve mental health outcomes**, on average, in randomized clinical trials.

## What works realistically (without a “perfect routine”)

<Card title="Sleep basics that actually move the needle">
### 1) A more stable wake-up time
You don’t need to fall asleep at the exact same time every night, but waking around a similar time helps stabilize your body clock.

### 2) Morning light, less light at night
Light exposure soon after waking (window, balcony, outside) is a strong cue for your body.

### 3) A 20-minute “wind-down window”
Not a glamorous ritual. Just a short period without conflict:
- warm shower  
- light reading  
- slow breathing  
- a calming playlist  

### 4) If you can’t sleep, don’t turn it into a courtroom
Avoid fighting insomnia in bed. Get up, do something calm, return when sleep comes back.
</Card>

<Callout type="note" title="A gentle rule">
If you’re awake and frustrated, the goal is not “try harder.”  
The goal is **reduce pressure** and **help sleep return**.
</Callout>

## A gentle 7-day plan

Pick **2 items per day** (that’s the whole plan):

<Card title="7-day gentle plan (choose 2 daily)">
- Morning light for **5–10 minutes**  
- Caffeine only until a set cutoff time  
- **20 minutes** of wind-down  
- Write worries before bed (2 columns: “worry” / “next action”)  
- Walk **10–20 minutes** at some point in the day  
- Reduce long naps  
</Card>

<Callout type="tip" title="How to make it stick">
Choose the two easiest options first.  
Consistency beats intensity in sleep land.
</Callout>

This isn’t about fixing yourself.  
It’s about creating conditions for your body to cooperate.

<Card title="A kinder target">
Aim for “a little better,” not “perfect.”
</Card>
