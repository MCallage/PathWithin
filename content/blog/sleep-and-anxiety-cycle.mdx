# Sleep and anxiety: they feed each other (and how to break the cycle without becoming a hostage to discipline)

When sleep gets worse, almost everything gets harder:
- emotional tolerance drops
- focus collapses
- catastrophic thoughts feel more “believable”

And when anxiety rises, sleep turns into an endurance test.

The scientific evidence is consistent on one important point: **interventions that improve sleep tend to improve mental health outcomes**, on average, in randomized clinical trials.

## What works realistically (without a “perfect routine”)

### 1) A more stable wake-up time
You don’t need to fall asleep at the exact same time every night, but waking around a similar time helps stabilize your body clock.

### 2) Morning light, less light at night
Light exposure soon after waking (window, balcony, outside) is a strong “cue” for your body.

### 3) A 20-minute “wind-down window”
Not a “glamorous ritual.” Just a short period without conflict:
- warm shower
- light reading
- slow breathing
- a calming playlist

### 4) If you can’t sleep, don’t turn it into a courtroom
Avoid “fighting” insomnia in bed. Get up, do something calm, return when sleep comes back.

## A gentle 7-day plan
Pick 2 items per day:

- Morning light for 5–10 minutes
- Caffeine only until a set cutoff time
- 20 minutes of wind-down
- write worries before bed (2 columns: “worry” / “next action”)
- walk 10–20 minutes at some point in the day
- reduce long naps

This isn’t about “fixing yourself.” It’s about creating conditions for your body to cooperate.
