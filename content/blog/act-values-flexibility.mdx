# ACT and anxiety: stop fighting your mind and come back to your values

Anxiety often turns into a war:

- me vs my thoughts  
- me vs my body  
- me vs my fear  

ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) offers a different route. Instead of spending energy trying to eliminate thoughts, it redirects energy toward **living what matters**, even while discomfort is present.

Reviews and meta-analyses suggest ACT can be effective across a range of psychological difficulties, including anxiety, with outcomes comparable to other established interventions in certain contexts.

<Card title="Tiny reframe">
ACT isn’t “how do I stop feeling this?”  
It’s “how do I live well while I feel this?”
</Card>

## The key idea: psychological flexibility

Psychological flexibility is the ability to:

- notice thoughts and emotions  
- without being dominated by them  
- and act in line with your values  

This isn’t “acceptance” as resignation. It’s accepting inner experience so you don’t accept a life on pause.

## A practical technique: defusion in 3 sentences

When a thought shows up like:

> “I’m going to ruin everything.”

Try this sequence:

1) **“I’m having the thought that I’m going to ruin everything.”**  
2) **“My mind is trying to protect me.”**  
3) **“And I can still take a small step.”**

It sounds simple, but it changes the thought’s role: from **boss** to **background noise**.

Swap it for: **“My mind is doing its job: generating alarms.”**  
Same idea, different tone.

## Values vs goals

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Goal">
    “Have a perfect relationship.”
  </Card>

  <Card title="Value">
    “Show up with honesty and kindness.”
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

Values are a compass. Goals are signposts.  
On hard days, the compass still works.

## A 10-minute exercise: back to what matters

Write:

- **What’s hard right now?**  
- **Which value do I want to honor anyway?** (courage, care, truth, freedom…)  
- **What is a 5-minute action that fits that value?**

<Card title="Examples of 5-minute actions">
- send a short, honest message  
- organize one tiny work step  
- take a 5-minute walk while breathing slowly  
- ask for help  
- set one boundary (small but real)
</Card>

<Callout type="note" title="Rule of thumb">
Choose something that’s **small enough to do today**,  
but **true enough to matter**.
</Callout>
