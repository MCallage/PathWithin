# ACT and anxiety: stop fighting your mind and come back to your values

Anxiety often turns into a war:
- me vs my thoughts  
- me vs my body  
- me vs my fear  

ACT (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy) offers a different route: instead of spending energy trying to eliminate thoughts, it redirects energy toward **living what matters**, even while discomfort is present.

Reviews and meta-analyses suggest ACT can be effective across a range of psychological difficulties, including anxiety, with outcomes comparable to other established interventions in certain contexts.

## The key idea: psychological flexibility
It’s the ability to:
- notice thoughts and emotions  
- without being dominated by them  
- and act in line with your values  

This isn’t “acceptance” as resignation. It’s accepting inner experience so you don’t accept a life on pause.

## A practical technique: defusion in 3 sentences

When a thought shows up like:
> “I’m going to ruin everything.”

Try:

1) **“I’m having the thought that I’m going to ruin everything.”**  
2) **“My mind is trying to protect me.”**  
3) **“And I can still take a small step.”**

It sounds simple. But it changes the thought’s role: from boss to background noise.

## Values vs goals
Goal: “have a perfect relationship”  
Value: “show up with honesty and kindness”  

Values are a compass. Goals are signposts.

On hard days, the compass still works.

## A 10-minute exercise: “back to what matters”
Write:

- **What’s hard right now?**  
- **Which value do I want to honor anyway?** (courage, care, truth, freedom…)  
- **What is a 5-minute action that fits that value?**

Examples of 5-minute actions:
- send a short, honest message  
- organize one tiny work step  
- take a 5-minute walk while breathing slowly  
- ask for help
