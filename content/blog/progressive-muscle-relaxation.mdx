# Progressive Muscle Relaxation: the ‘unclench’ button for an anxious body

Anxiety isn’t just thoughts.
It’s also **jaw pressure**, **shoulders near your ears**, **hands gripping life** like it’s a slippery soap bar.

Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) is old-school and surprisingly effective for many people:
you deliberately tense a muscle group, then release it, teaching the nervous system the difference between “on” and “off.”

Reviews and meta-analyses often find **reductions in anxiety and stress** with relaxation-based interventions, including PMR, depending on population and protocol.

## PMR is not “calm vibes only”
PMR is closer to **physical literacy**:
“Oh, that’s what tension feels like.”
“Oh, that’s what release feels like.”

That awareness alone can lower background alarm.

## A 7-minute PMR routine (no perfection required)

Do this sitting or lying down.
Breathe normally.

For each area:
- Tense gently for **5 seconds**
- Release for **10–15 seconds**
- Notice the difference (that’s the point)

### 1) Hands
Make fists (not painful). Release.

### 2) Shoulders
Shrug up toward ears. Release.

### 3) Face and jaw
Press lips together, clench lightly. Release.  
Let the tongue rest.

### 4) Belly
Tighten abdomen (as if bracing). Release.

### 5) Legs and feet
Press feet down or tighten thighs. Release.

Finish with one sentence:
**“My body got the message.”**

## If PMR makes you more aware of discomfort
That can happen, especially if you’re highly stressed.
Adjust:
- shorter tension (2–3 seconds)
- fewer muscle groups
- do only hands + shoulders

Small is still real.

## A daily micro-version (60 seconds)
Pick one “signature clamp” area:
jaw, shoulders, fists, stomach.

Then:
- tense 3 seconds
- release 10 seconds
- repeat 3 times

It’s like teaching your body a new default.
