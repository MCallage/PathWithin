# Progressive Muscle Relaxation: the ‘unclench’ button for an anxious body

Anxiety isn’t just thoughts.  
It’s also **jaw pressure**, **shoulders near your ears**, **hands gripping life** like it’s a slippery soap bar.

Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) is old-school and surprisingly effective for many people: you deliberately tense a muscle group, then release it, teaching your nervous system the difference between **“on”** and **“off.”**

Reviews and meta-analyses often find **reductions in anxiety and stress** with relaxation-based interventions, including PMR, depending on population and protocol.

<Card title="What PMR trains">
PMR builds a skill: **noticing tension early** and **releasing on purpose**.
</Card>

## PMR is not “calm vibes only”

PMR is closer to **physical literacy**:

- “Oh, *that’s* what tension feels like.”  
- “Oh, *that’s* what release feels like.”  

That awareness alone can lower the background alarm.

<Callout type="note" title="This is why it works even on messy days">
You don’t need to feel peaceful.  
You just need to practice the **tension → release** pattern.
</Callout>

## A 7-minute PMR routine (no perfection required)

Do this sitting or lying down.  
Breathe normally.

For each area:

- Tense gently for **5 seconds**  
- Release for **10–15 seconds**  
- Notice the difference (that’s the point)  

<Card title="7-minute PMR">
### 1) Hands
Make fists (not painful). Release.

### 2) Shoulders
Shrug up toward ears. Release.

### 3) Face and jaw
Press lips together, clench lightly. Release.  
Let the tongue rest.

### 4) Belly
Tighten abdomen (as if bracing). Release.

### 5) Legs and feet
Press feet down or tighten thighs. Release.
</Card>

Finish with one sentence:

<Card title="Closing line">
**“My body got the message.”**
</Card>

## If PMR makes you more aware of discomfort

That can happen, especially if you’re highly stressed. Adjust:

<Card title="Make it gentler">
- shorter tension (**2–3 seconds**)  
- fewer muscle groups  
- do only **hands + shoulders**  
</Card>

Small is still real.

<Callout type="tip" title="The “right” intensity">
Aim for **60% tension**, not 100%.  
This is training, not a strength test.
</Callout>

## A daily micro-version (60 seconds)

Pick one “signature clamp” area: jaw, shoulders, fists, stomach.

<Card title="60-second unclench">
- tense **3 seconds**  
- release **10 seconds**  
- repeat **3 times**  
</Card>

It’s like teaching your body a new default.
