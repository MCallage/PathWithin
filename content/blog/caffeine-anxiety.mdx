# Caffeine and anxiety: how to find your personal threshold (without fear)

Caffeine is a useful tool.
It is also, for many anxious nervous systems, a tiny chaos gremlin in a mug.

Research broadly suggests that caffeine can increase anxiety symptoms in susceptible individuals and can trigger anxiety-like sensations (heart rate, jitteriness, restlessness), especially at higher doses or in sensitive groups.

But this is not a moral issue.
It’s a nervous-system compatibility issue.

## A helpful reframe
Instead of “I should quit caffeine,” try:

**“I want to know my threshold.”**

Some people do fine.
Some people do better with less.
Some people do best with none.

Your job is not to be “disciplined.”
Your job is to be **informed**.

## The 4-day self-test (gentle, not extreme)

### Day 1: baseline
Drink your usual amount.
At 3 times (morning / afternoon / evening), rate:
- anxiety (0–10)
- restlessness (0–10)
- sleep quality last night (0–10)

### Day 2: reduce by 25–50%
Example: 2 coffees becomes 1 coffee + decaf.

Same ratings.

### Day 3: caffeine earlier
Keep the same amount as Day 2, but set a cutoff:
**no caffeine after 12 pm** (or 2 pm if needed).

Same ratings.

### Day 4: low-caffeine day
Try decaf or tea only.

Now compare:
- Which day felt steadier?
- Which day helped sleep?
- Which day made your thoughts less spiky?

## A replacement that doesn’t feel like punishment
If you like the ritual, keep the ritual:
- decaf coffee
- herbal tea
- warm water with lemon
- “first sip” as a grounding cue

The comfort is often the ceremony, not the stimulant.
