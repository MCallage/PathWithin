# The body as an ally: slow breathing and movement to reduce anxiety (without performance pressure)

An anxious mind asks for certainty. The body can offer something else: **rhythm**.

Two tools with a solid research base (across varied contexts) are:

- **slow breathing** (slow-paced / voluntary slow breathing)  
- **physical activity** (especially in consistent, accessible formats)

<Card title="Why these two work well together">
They’re both **low-tech, repeatable**, and they regulate anxiety through two doors:  
**physiology** (nervous system signals) and **attention** (where the mind lands).
</Card>

## Slow breathing: why does it feel like it “works right away”?

Breathing more slowly can influence physiological parameters linked to the autonomic nervous system, such as measures of heart rate variability (HRV), often associated with emotion regulation.

Reviews and meta-analyses indicate reliable effects on physiological markers and modest effects on negative emotions, with results depending on protocol, frequency, and context.

<Card title="A simple protocol (4 minutes)">
- Inhale through your nose for **4–5s**  
- Exhale for **6–7s**  
- Repeat for **4 minutes**
</Card>

<Callout type="tip" title="If it feels uncomfortable">
Scale down without guilt: do **3 minutes**, or shorten the exhale.  
The goal is **steady and doable**, not “perfect pacing”.
</Callout>

## Movement: anxiety needs an outlet

Anxiety is energy. The body was built to metabolize it.

Meta-analyses suggest that physical activity interventions can reduce anxiety symptoms with, on average, moderate effects in some populations, and reviews point to a protective role against anxiety symptoms/disorders.

<Card title="Minimum viable (for rough days)">
Choose one:

- **10 minutes of walking**  
- **5 minutes of stretching + 5 minutes of walking around the house**  
- **climb stairs slowly for 3–5 minutes**
</Card>

The goal isn’t performance. It’s to signal your system:

<Callout type="note" title="The message to your nervous system">
“I’m moving. I’m not stuck.”
</Callout>

## The golden combo: 10 + 4

If you want a simple “default”:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="10">
    **10 minutes** of light walking.
  </Card>

  <Card title="4">
    **4 minutes** of slow breathing (4–5s in, 6–7s out).
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

This often helps because it works through two doors: **physiology** and **attention**.

<Callout type="tip" title="Make it easier to repeat">
Tie it to something you already do:  
after lunch, after a shower, before bed, or right after you close your laptop.
</Callout>
