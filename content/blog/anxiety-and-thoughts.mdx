# Anxiety and thoughts: a simple CBT-inspired record to slow your mind down

Anxiety is a storyteller. And its favorite story is: “this is going to go badly.”

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is one of the most studied approaches for anxiety disorders, with reviews and meta-analyses supporting its effectiveness across different conditions. The part we can use day-to-day is simple:

**a thought isn’t a fact.**

## The minimal map: Situation → Thought → Emotion → Action

When you feel anxious, try to capture:

### 1) Situation (what happened)
Example: “She replied curtly.”

### 2) Automatic thought (what my mind concluded)
Example: “She’s distant because I’m not important.”

### 3) Emotion (0–10)
Example: “fear 8/10, sadness 6/10”

### 4) Action/urge
Example: “send 10 messages / disappear / blame myself”

Just writing this down can shift your state, because it pulls you out of the “movie” and puts you back in the “driver’s seat.”

## The question that changes everything: “What’s the evidence?”

Here’s the key move:

- **Evidence for** the thought
- **Evidence against** the thought
- **A fairer alternative interpretation**

Example:
- For: “she’s replying less”
- Against: “she’s gone quiet from exhaustion before; yesterday she was kind”
- Alternative: “she might be busy or shut down today; that doesn’t prove my worth”

The goal isn’t “positive thinking.” It’s thinking **accurately**.

## The short version (for 2 minutes)
Fill in:

- **Fact:** ______
- **My story:** ______
- **Another possible story:** ______
- **Next small action:** ______

That last line is gold. Anxiety hates “small action.” It wants the full drama. You take one step and show who’s still holding the wheel.
