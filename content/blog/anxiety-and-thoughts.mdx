# Anxiety and thoughts: a simple CBT-inspired record to slow your mind down

Anxiety is a storyteller. And its favorite story is: **“this is going to go badly.”**

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is one of the most studied approaches for anxiety disorders, with reviews and meta-analyses supporting its effectiveness across different conditions.

The part we can use day-to-day is simple:

<Card title="Core principle">
**A thought isn’t a fact.**
</Card>

## The minimal map: Situation → Thought → Emotion → Action

When you feel anxious, try to capture four pieces. The goal is not to “solve everything”, but to **separate what happened from what your mind predicted**.

<Card title="The 4-step record">
### 1) Situation (what happened)
Example: “She replied curtly.”

### 2) Automatic thought (what my mind concluded)
Example: “She’s distant because I’m not important.”

### 3) Emotion (0–10)
Example: “fear 8/10, sadness 6/10”

### 4) Action / urge
Example: “send 10 messages / disappear / blame myself”
</Card>

<Callout type="note" title="Why writing helps">
It pulls you out of the “movie” and puts you back in the driver’s seat.  
Once the story is on paper, it stops feeling like absolute truth.
</Callout>

## The question that changes everything: “What’s the evidence?”

Here’s the key move:

- **Evidence for** the thought  
- **Evidence against** the thought  
- **A fairer alternative interpretation**  

<Card title="Example (filled in)">
**Thought:** “She’s distant because I’m not important.”

**Evidence for:** “She’s replying less.”

**Evidence against:** “She’s gone quiet from exhaustion before; yesterday she was kind.”

**Alternative:** “She might be busy or shut down today. That doesn’t prove my worth.”
</Card>

The goal isn’t “positive thinking.” It’s thinking **accurately**.

<Callout type="tip" title="A helpful check">
If your alternative interpretation sounds fake, make it **neutral** instead of positive:  
“She replied less. I don’t know why yet. I can wait and choose a calm next step.”
</Callout>

## The short version (for 2 minutes)

When you’re overwhelmed, use the compressed form:

<Card title="2-minute version">
- **Fact:** ______  
- **My story:** ______  
- **Another possible story:** ______  
- **Next small action:** ______
</Card>

That last line is gold. Anxiety hates **small action**. It wants the full drama.

You take one step and show who’s still holding the wheel.

<Callout type="note" title="Make the last line tiny">
If you can’t decide, shrink it until it’s doable in 60 seconds:  
drink water, open the doc, write one sentence, send one message, stand up and stretch.
</Callout>
