# Expressive writing: a 10-minute practice to metabolize emotional overload

Some feelings don’t want solutions.  
They want movement.

Expressive writing is the practice of writing freely about thoughts and emotions, often for short sessions. Across decades of research, reviews and meta-analyses suggest small-to-moderate benefits in certain outcomes (stress, well-being, sometimes anxiety), with effects depending on context, population, and how it’s done.

<Card title="What this is (and isn’t)">
This isn’t “positive journaling.”  
It’s **honest** journaling.
</Card>

## The goal

Not to be eloquent.  
Not to be consistent.  
Not to “heal instantly.”

Just:

<Card title="The real goal">
**Give your nervous system a way to process.**
</Card>

<Callout type="note" title="A helpful expectation">
Think of this like emotional digestion.  
You’re not trying to *fix* the feeling. You’re letting it *move through*.
</Callout>

## The 10-minute structure (safer than total free-fall)

Set a timer for **10 minutes**.

<Card title="10-minute structure">
### Minute 1–3: what happened
Describe the situation plainly.  
No interpretation yet.

### Minute 4–7: what it felt like
Name sensations and emotions.  
Use simple language.

### Minute 8–10: meaning + next step
Finish with:
- “What I need is ______.”
- “One small step is ______.”
</Card>

That last line prevents the page from becoming a sinkhole.

<Callout type="tip" title="If you tend to overthink">
Keep the sentences short.  
Your job is “signal clarity,” not literary quality.
</Callout>

## If you spiral while writing

Stop. Put both feet on the floor.  
Then write one sentence only:

<Card title="One-sentence reset">
**“Right now, my body needs ______.”**
</Card>

Water. Air. A shower. A walk. A text to a friend.  
Let the body steer.

<Callout type="note" title="This is still success">
Stopping early is not failure.  
It’s **self-regulation** in real time.
</Callout>

## A 2-minute micro version (for survival days)

<Card title="2-minute micro version">
- “The loudest feeling is ______.”  
- “It makes sense because ______.”  
- “My next small step is ______.”  
</Card>

That’s enough to shift the state.
